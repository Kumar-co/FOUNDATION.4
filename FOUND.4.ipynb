    "A **tuple** in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists in that they can hold multiple items, but unlike lists, once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified (i.e., you cannot add, remove, or change items). This immutability makes tuples useful for storing fixed collections of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered**: The elements in a tuple have a defined order, which means that they can be accessed by their position (index).\n",
    "2. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, which means you cannot add or remove items or modify existing ones.\n",
    "3. **Allow Duplicate Values**: Tuples can contain multiple occurrences of the same element.\n",
    "4. **Can Contain Mixed Data Types**: Tuples can hold items of different data types, such as integers, strings, lists, or even other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Tuple:\n",
    "You can create a tuple by placing a comma-separated list of elements inside parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with integers\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with mixed data types\n",
    "mixed_tuple = (1, \"Hello\", 3.14, True)\n",
    "print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, \"Hello\", 3.14, True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with a single element (note the comma)\n",
    "single_element_tuple = (5,)\n",
    "print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: (5,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Tuple Elements:\n",
    "You can access the elements of a tuple using indexing (starting from 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2\n",

    "You can create a tuple in Python by placing a comma-separated list of elements inside parentheses `()`. Here are some methods to create tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Using Parentheses `()`**:\n",
    "You can define a tuple directly by enclosing the elements in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with integers\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple with mixed data types\n",
    "mixed_tuple = (1, \"Hello\", 3.14, True)\n",
    "print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, 'Hello', 3.14, True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Using a Comma without Parentheses**:\n",
    "If you have a sequence of elements separated by commas, Python will interpret it as a tuple even without parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Creating a Single-Element Tuple**:\n",
    "To create a tuple with a single element, you must include a trailing comma. Without the comma, Python will interpret it as just that single element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single-element tuple\n",
    "single_element_tuple = (5,)\n",
    "print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: (5,)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Without the comma, it's just an integer\n",
    "not_a_tuple = (5)\n",
    "print(type(not_a_tuple))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using the `tuple()` Constructor**:\n",
    "You can also create a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor, which can take any iterable (like a list or string) as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple from a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_tuple_from_list = tuple(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_tuple_from_list)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tuple from a string\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_tuple_from_string = tuple(my_string)\n",
    "print(my_tuple_from_string)  # Output: ('H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')\n",

    "The main differences between tuples and lists in Python can be summarized in several key aspects, including mutability, syntax, performance, and use cases. Here's a detailed comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mutability**:\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Immutable. Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.\n",
    "- **List**: Mutable. You can modify a list by adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[1] = 4  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# List\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[1] = 4  # This is valid\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Syntax**:\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Created using parentheses `()`.\n",
    "- **List**: Created using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Performance**:\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Generally faster than lists when it comes to iteration and access. Because of their immutability, tuples require less memory overhead.\n",
    "- **List**: Slightly slower than tuples because they are mutable, requiring more memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Used when you want to ensure that the data remains constant and unchanged. Commonly used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, RGB color values, or records with multiple fields.\n",
    "- **List**: Used for collections of items that may need to change or be updated. Lists are ideal for storing items that you may want to add or remove, such as user input or dynamic datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Methods**:\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Has fewer built-in methods. Mainly supports indexing and slicing, along with methods like `count()` and `index()`.\n",
    "- **List**: Offers a wide variety of methods for manipulation, including `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and more.\n",

    "### Example of Tuple vs. List Methods:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Tuple Immutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Item Assignment**: You cannot assign a new value to an existing index in a tuple.\n",

    "   # my_tuple.remove(2)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating a New Tuple**: If you want to \"change\" a tuple, you can create a new tuple that combines elements from the original tuple with the new elements. However, this is effectively creating a new object rather than modifying the original tuple.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Accessing a Range of Elements by Slicing**:\n",
    "You can also access a range of elements in a tuple using slicing. This allows you to get a sub-tuple from the original tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
